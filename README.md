# HTML Structure Implementation - Figma Design

This project focuses on implementing the HTML structure of a webpage based on a Figma design file. The goal is to create a well-organized, semantic HTML structure without any CSS or styling. This approach emphasizes clarity, accessibility, and semantic correctness.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A web browser to preview the HTML structure.
- Access to [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to view the design and its details. You can duplicate the design file to your drafts to get full access.
  - **Designer File**: [Figma Project Link](#)
  - Ensure that you have access to the required fonts if needed:
    - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
    - [Spin Cycle OT](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Spin-Cycle-OT)

### Installation

No installation is required. This project is purely HTML-based, so you can view the output by opening the HTML files in any modern browser.

### Instructions

1. **Implement the HTML Structure**:

   - Focus only on the HTML structure, ensuring that it reflects the design in a meaningful and semantic way.
   - No CSS or styles should be applied at this stage.
   - Some dimensions and values in Figma might be in float; you are free to round them as needed.

2. **Check for Semantic Accuracy**:
   - Ensure the use of proper HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.).
   - Prioritize accessibility (e.g., adding `alt` text for images, using meaningful `aria` attributes if necessary).

### Project Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the semantic structure of the webpage as per the Figma design.

### Fonts

- Ensure your system supports the fonts used in the design:
  - **Source Sans Pro**
  - **Spin Cycle OT**

### Design Notes

- **Rounded Values**: Some Figma values might be in float. Feel free to round them to the nearest appropriate value for HTML implementation.
- **No Styling**: This project focuses only on the structural HTML aspects. CSS or any other styling will be addressed in future iterations.

### Feedback

Feel free to provide any feedback or suggestions regarding the structure or implementation!
